# TGView
The TGView System is a browser-based theory graph viewer developed at the [KWARC group](http://kwarc.info) at [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](http://www.fau.de) by Marcel Rupprecht (with help/supervision by Dennis Müller and Michael Kohlhase).  

We value your feedback, please consult the [GitHub issues](issues/) for planned extensions and feel free to [open  a new issue](issues/new) if you have comments. 

## Documentation
There is a [MathUI-2017 paper](https://kwarc.info/kohlhase/papers/mathui17-tgview.pdf) that describes
the system at a conceptual level. Technical information can be found in the [TGView Wiki](https://github.com/UniFormal/TGView/wiki)
